# Weather App

This application displays real time weather for different locations picked by the user through the search engine. Further, the app includes forecast data for the upcoming week.
The project uses an API from openweathermap.org, is hosted on netflify and deploys from GitHub.

The project followed below mentioned steps:

1. Setup project
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Search Engine
5. API integration
6. Forecast

7. Summary:
   Unit conversion as well as the button to display the weater forecast by current location were removed in order to keep the application sipmle and vanilla code readable.
   During the process of building the application, some issues with the openweathermap.org API occured (mainly in regards to the API key). For a future project I advise therefore to research other API options.
   The CSS could be further improved but this project mainly focusses on the functionality.
   Another feature for the application could be to display the local time for the search result using for instance Google Time Zone API.
